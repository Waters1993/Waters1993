# Welcome to my GitHub profileðŸ‘‹
--- 
My name is James Waters. I'm a Software Engineer living in Boston Massachusetts. I'm currently working with the Ruby on Rails and React frameworks. 

I transitioned to software engineering following a 6 year career in the Medical Device industry where I worked as a Project Engineer. Over the course of my career I launched a number of new products including orthopaedic hip and knee implants as well as tissue repair devices.

I am completely self taught software engineer. I started my journey by completing  the HarvardX introductory course CS50. Since then I have completed a number of online open courses and created a project portfolio. I am continuing my journey with more deep form learning 
through text books and more complex projects. 

My goals for 2023 are to:
- Contribute to Open Source projects
- Take on my first freelance webdevelopment work
- Get a new role as a software engineer
